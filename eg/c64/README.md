This directory contains SixtyPical example programs
specifically for the Commodore 64.

Subdirectories of note:

*   [demo-game](demo-game/): a little game-like program written as a
    "can we write something you'd see in practice?" test case for SixtyPical.
*   [ribos](ribos/): a well-commented example of a C64 raster interrupt
    routine. Originally written with the P65 assembler (now Ophis).
    The second version of it has been translated to SixtyPical.
*   [petulant](petulant/) -- "The PETulant Cursor", a tiny (44 bytes)
    "display hack". Originally written in the late 80's. Rewritten with
    the P65 assembler (now Ophis) and re-released April 1, 2008 (a
    hint as to its nature). Translated to SixtyPical, it's 48 bytes.
