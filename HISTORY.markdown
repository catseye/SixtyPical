History of SixtyPical
=====================

0.1
---

Initial inspired-but-messy version implemented in Haskell.

0.2
---

A complete reboot of SixtyPical 0.1.  The reference implementation was
rewritten in Python.  The language was much simplified.  The aim was to get the
analysis completely right before adding more sophisticated and useful features
in future versions.

0.3
---

Added ability to compile to 6502 machine code and output a `PRG` file.

0.4
---

Added `repeat` loops to the language.
