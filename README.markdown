SixtyPical
==========

SixtyPical is a very low-level programming language, similar to 6502 assembly,
with static analysis through abstract interpretation.

In practice, this means it catches things like

*   you forgot to clear carry before adding something to the accumulator
*   a subroutine that you call trashes a register you thought was preserved

and suchlike.

It is a **work in progress**, currently at the **proof-of-concept** stage.

The current released version of SixtyPical is 0.4.  The current development
version of SixtyPical, unreleased as of this writing, is 0.5-PRE.
